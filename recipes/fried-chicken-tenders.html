      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are juicy, fried tendies that taste fantastic with almost any sauce you can think of (although I recommend buffalo sauce). Serve them with your favorite potato salad and corn on the cob.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>24 chicken tenderloins</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow bowl. Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow bowl, and mix with ground black pepper and cayenne pepper. Place eggs in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>One piece at a time, coat the chicken in the flour, the eggs and the bread crumbs, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In small batches, fry chicken 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove chicken, and drain on paper towels.</li>
          </ol>
